			<li id="1">General Rules<p class="comment">rules apply to all classes unless otherwise specified.
				<ol class="subsect">
					<li>
						TRACK OFFICALS DECISION WILL BE FINAL. ANY DISAGREEMENT ON THEIR DECISION ON ANY POINT OF CONTROVERSY WILL RESULT IN DISQUALIFICATION FOR THAT CLASS FOR THE DAY. <p class="comment">Comment: The track officials have the final say on what happens on the track.</p>

					</li>
					<li>
						YOUR TRACTOR MUST MEET ALL SAFETY AND SHIELDING REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO HOOKING OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE AND THERE WILL BE NO REFUND OF ENTRY.
					</li>
				</ol>

			</li>
			<li id="2">Track Operations:
				<ol class="subsect">
					<li>
						Driver must put his tractor in a neutral position and be hand pushed to the sled. Tractor must be shut down before chain will be unhooked from tractor. <p class="comment"> Comment: Flag men will enforce this rule for the safety of the track help. See <a href="#1">Rule 1</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						No portion of the tractor shall interfere with the sled hitch during pull. <p class="comment"> Comment: Many times the starting line becomes torn up, which will cause the front of the tractor to be lower than the rear tires. This may cause an interference of the cross bar for the wheelie wheels. The intent of the rule is not to interfere once the pull is underway. See <a href="#1">Rule 1</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Any portion of tractor touching boundary line during pull will result in disqualification. This would be limited to the front or the rear tires. There is no out of bounds once the tractor passes the full pull mark. See <a href="#1">Rule 1</a>. The entire tractor must pass the full pull mark.
					</li>
					<li>
						Two attempts will be allowed to start sled except in pull-offs. One attempt only in a pull-off.<p class="comment"> Comment: An attempt is considered once the hook goes in the hitch and driver physically tries to start the tractor in motion by revving up the engine and attempting to release the clutch. See <a href="#1">Rule 1</a>.</p></li>
					<li>
						The first puller can drop five places which mean he or she will actually start in the 6th position or they can come back immediately. If they do drop, they drop to the 6th position.
					</li>
					<li id="2f">If a puller has a mechanical problem they have to drop back 6 positions (five more pull then they hook). If there are less than five tractors remaining, they have until the end of the heat plus five (5) minutes. If they are not able to hook within the allotted time they will receive last place in that heat. THE PULLER CAN NOT DROP TO ANOTHER HEAT - it would be unfair to the others in those heats.
					</li>
					<li>
						Driver will be disqualified if he or she delays contest.<p class="comment"> Comment: A puller is expected to have their tractor running by the time the sled gets back to the starting point, If the puller delays more than 90 seconds he will have to drop as discussed in <a href="#2f">2-F</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Pulling position will be determined by drawing. The drawing should be done prior to the event for the heats. Pullers (individuals, siblings and spouses) with more than one tractor in a class will be put in separate heats. It is recommended late entries the day of the pull will be staggered throughout the line up and heats. All Classes having more than 30 or more tractors will be run in heats. PS, SS and SA will run in 4 heats with the top 6 in each heat going to the finals (24 tractors in finals) Pro Outlaw and Pro/Super/Twin will run in 2 heats with the top 7 going to the finals.
					</li>
					<li>
						Driver must remain seated during pull. Drivers must have at least on hand on the steering wheel at all times.
					</li>
					<li>
						Weight transfer sled will be used. Either self-propelled or pull back. Must be a 3 foot chain with the hook point within 2 inches or less of the ground. All slam bars on sleds must be mechanically operated. No air, electrical or hydraulic slam devices accepted. Recommend all sleds be a single axle design. Tandem axle sleds tend to steer tractors once they are turned and tractors are more likely to become uncontrollable than with single axle sleds.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tractors must be operated in a safe manner at all times
					</li>
					<li>
						All weights must be safely secured to the tractor. Any excessive or obvious loss of weights or components may be cause for disqualification. The flagman must make the call during the pull. Any disqualification for loss of weight or component must be made during the pull. A pull is started when the sled starts to move and is ended when the sled stops movement, even though the tractor may still be under power.
					</li>
					<li>
						Track officials have the right to restart the class anytime within the first seven (7), either for full pulls or short tracking.
					</li>
					<li>
						A tractor can only enter one time per class.
					</li>
					<li>
						A tractor engine can only pull one time during the finals, cannot be switched from one tractor to another ... AKA "The Black Nichols Rule". A puller is able to put in a back up engine, but not from another tractor pulling in the same finals.

				<li id="5">Fuel:
					<ol class="subsect">
						<li>

							All tractors in all classes are to run Methanol(unless otherwise specified), with no additives. There are two U.S. Federal Grades. Grade A and AA. Either grade is permitted to use. Pullers should ensure that the methanol they purchase meets federal standards of purity. Methanol is tested at all NQS events by various chemical analyses as considered appropriate by the NQS Fuel Tech personnel. Deviation from the standards listed below in the fuel sample will result in disqualification. Methanol is a hygroscopic substance and readily absorbs moisture from the air, which rapidly renders methanol illegal as a fuel for use in NQS pulling. Pullers are cautioned to keep methanol containers tightly sealed at all times to minimize the absorption of water.

							Diesel fueled tractors must run diesel only with a dielectric value of no greater then 4.9 or less than 2.2. The dielectric meter shall use Cyclohexane to establish the zero reference point in determining all diesel fuel dielectric constant values. The use of additives containing oxygen, such as nitromethane, propylene oxide, dioaxane, MTBE, alcohol (methanol), or nitrous oxide is prohibited. These additives, and others of the oxygen-bearing family, will significantly change the dielectric values of diesel fuel.

							<strong>Gas:</strong> must be either VP C-12 or VP C-15. No oxygenated fuels allowed.

							Fuel Injection is allowed in Super Stock, Nitro 30 Cubes in Lite Pro and Open Super Stock Classes (non diesel-fueled engines).

				<li id="6"> Tear Down and Illegal Vehicles
					<ol class="subsect">
						<li>
							All top money winners will have their engines checked for legality. Teching will include, but not limited to the engine. Remember, if you don&#39;t want the NQS tech official to see parts of your engine that is not involved with the tear down process, cover it up. Any person who refuses to be inspected for eligibility by routine check of money winners shall not be allowed to enter and/or pull in the class in question until legality is checked. See <a href="#1">Rule 1</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Tractors that fail the engine tear down will be removed from the NQS Points Championship. You will be able to compete at the events after your vehicle is checked for legality after the infraction occurred and the disqualification is only for the remainder of the season. Overweight, over length, hitch height infraction, failing the fuel test or the carb check will result in no points for that class for that day. Out-of-bounds will result in last place points for that heat for that class. V-Twin and Diesel engines will be pumped to check Cubic Inch.
						</li>
						<li>
							Illegal Parts. The NQS reserves the right that they may confiscate illegal parts and display them at the events and on the NQS web site <a href="www.nqspulling.org">www.nqspulling.org</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							NQS Tech Officials can overrule any misprints in these rules.
